    <h2>Descriptions:</h2>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_brownie">chocolate brownie</a> 
        (commonly referred to simply as a brownie) is a 
        square or rectangular, chocolate baked treat. Brownies come in a 
        variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their 
        density. They may include nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate 
        chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with brown sugar and 
        vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blond brownie 
        or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at the end
        of the 19th century and popularized in the U.S. and Canada during the 
        first half of the 20th century.
