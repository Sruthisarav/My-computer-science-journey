# My-computer-science-journey-2019

This is my progress in mastering basic computer science concepts using online resources like edX, coursera, and Udacity. I am creating this repository to store all of my solutions to problem sets given in these courses for future references. 

I'm making use of the OSSU curriculum to master the basics before I move on to my own path to specialize in specific areas so you will see a lot of similarities in the first half of the courses I'll be taking. The order of courses is based on the order in which I had taken them.
