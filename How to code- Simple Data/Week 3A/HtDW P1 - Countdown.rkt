;; countdown-animation starter.rkt

; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design an animation of a simple countdown. 
; 
; Your program should display a simple countdown, that starts at ten, and
; decreases by one each clock tick until it reaches zero, and stays there.
; 
; To make your countdown progress at a reasonable speed, you can use the 
; rate option to on-tick. If you say, for example, 
; (on-tick advance-countdown 1) then big-bang will wait 1 second between 
; calls to advance-countdown.
; 
; Remember to follow the HtDW recipe! Be sure to do a proper domain 
; analysis before starting to work on the code file.
; 
; Once you are finished the simple version of the program, you can improve
; it by reseting the countdown to ten when you press the spacebar.

;; Countdown

;; =================
;; Constants:
(define WIDTH 600)
(define HEIGHT 400)
(define CTR-Y (/ HEIGHT 2))
(define CTR-X (/ WIDTH 2))
(define MTS (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))
(define SPEED 1)
(define TEXT-SIZE 150)
(define TEXT-COLOUR "blue")

;; =================
;; Data definitions:

;; Countdown is Natural
;; interp. the time taken to reach 0
(define t0 10)
(define t1 5)
(define t2 0)
#;
(define (fn-for-countdown t)

;; - atomic non-distinct: Natural
